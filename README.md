# Greedy Technique for a knapsack problem

This code allows the user to insert 7 items with profit & weight corresponding to each item, all of them in a dictionary.
The user can determine whether it's a maximum profit approach,minimum weight or maximum profit/weight.
I used bubble sort to sort the items in the 3 approches.
